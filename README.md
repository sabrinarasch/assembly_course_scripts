## Roadmap

### Week 1 - reads & QC
The goal of week 1 was to run a QC on the datasets and perform k-mer counting. For the k-mer counting a additional script was used *best_k.sh*, with the genomsize as 150'000'000, which resulted in an optimal k of 19.

* Scripts: 01_01_fastqc_QC.sh, 01_02_jellyfish_kmer.sh
* Software: fastqc 0.11.9, jellyfish 2.3.0
* Input:
    * 1.1: Raw reads (fastq)
    * 1.2: Raw reads (fastq)
* Output: 01_read_QC
    * 1.1: fastqc
    * 1.2: kmer

### Week 2 - assembly
The goal of week 2 was to generate three assemblies. Two whole genome assemblies using flye and canu and one whole transcriptome assembly using Trinity. The whole genome assemblies were done using the pacbio reads and the whole transcriptome assembly was done using the RNAseq reads.

* Scripts: 02_01_flye_assembly.sh, 02_02_canu_assembly.sh, 02_03_trinity_assembly.sh
* Software: flye 2.8.3, canu 2.1.1, trinityrnaseq 2.5.1
* Input:
    * 2.1: Raw reads of pacbio (fastq)
    * 2.2: Raw reads of pacbio (fastq)
    * 2.3: Raw reads of RNAseq (fastq)
* Output: 02_assembly
    * 2.1: flye
    * 2.2: canu
    * 2.3: trinity

### Week 3 - assembly polishing and evaluation
The goal of week 3 was to improve the draft assemblies and evaluate them. The polishing of the assemblies was done using the Illumina reads. The scripts 3.1 and 3.2 were run on the unpolished assemblies from canu and flye. The evaluation was done on all assemblies. The script 3.3 was run on the unpolished assemblies from canu, flye and trinity, and the polished assemblies from canu and flye. The scripts 3.4 and 3.6 were run on the unpolished assemblies from canu and flye, and the polished assemblies from canu and flye.

* Scripts: 03_01_bowtie2_polishing.sh, 03_02_pilon_polishing.sh, 03_03_BUSCO_evaluation.sh, 03_04_QUAST_evaluation.sh, 03_05_meryl_evaluation.sh, 03_06_merqury_evaluation.sh
* Software: bowtie2 2.3.4.1, samtools 1.10, pilon 1.22, busco 4.1.4, quast 4.6.0, merqury 1.3.1
* Input:
    * 3.1: Raw assembly of canu and flye (fasta)
    * 3.2: Raw assembly of canu and flye (fasta)
    * 3.3: Raw and polished assembly of canu and flye, raw assembly of trinity (fasta)
    * 3.4: Raw and polished assembly of canu and flye, reference of *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome (fasta)
    * 3.5: Raw reads of illumina (fasta)
    * 3.6: Raw and polished assembly of canu and flye (fasta), meryl file of genome (meryl)
* Output: 03_polish_evaluation
    * 3.1: polish/index; polish/align
    * 3.2: polish/pilon
    * 3.3: evaluation/BUSCO; evaluation_no_polish/BUSCO
    * 3.4: evaluation/QUAST; evaluation_no_polish/QUAST
    * 3.5: evaluation/meryl
    * 3.6: evaluation/merqury; evaluation_no_polish/merqury

### Week 4 - comparing genomes
The goal of week 4 was to compare the assemblies from canu and flye to the *Arabidopsis thaliana* reference and to each other.

* Scripts: 04_01_nucmer_comparison.sh, 04_02_mummer_comparison.sh
* Software: mummer 4.0.0
* Input:
    * 4.1: Raw assembly of canu and flye, reference of *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome (fasta)
    * 4.2: Raw assembly of canu and flye, reference of *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome (fasta), nucmer delta file (delta)
* Output: 04_comparison
    * 4.1: nucmer
    * 4.2: mummer
